        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I know from experience that duck is like chicken, but somehow better.  I would be remiss if I didn't include some sort of duck recipe on my page.</p>
            <p>This recipe for roasted duck, courtesy of user Rhonda Brock Fuller on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/65147/roasted-duck/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allrecipes</a>, may not be as exotic as the other recipes on my page, but it doesn't need to be, as duck speaks for itself.</p>
