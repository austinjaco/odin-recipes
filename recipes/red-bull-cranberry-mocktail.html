        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
            <p>I found this recipe on the Food Lion website, of all places.  Well, more specifically, I found it on Google from searching "red bull mocktails," and then it took me to some discontinued/counterfeit/malicious version of the Food Lion website.  I couldn't find it on their actual website, and when I first tried to access it from this weird facsimile website, it blocked me.</p>
            <p>So, I'll refrain from linking it here, but I assure you this is a real, non-malicious recipe.  (Based on my knowledge of the simple ingredients, at least.)</p>
        <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (12 fl oz) can Red Bull Energy Drink (I prefer Sugarfree)</li>
                <li>2 cups cranberry juice</li>
                <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
                <li>2 cans ginger beer</li>
                <li>Â½ cup fresh cranberries</li>
                <li>Lemons, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>Ice</li>
                <li>Cinnamon sticks (optional, but not optional for me!)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pitcher, place some ice, followed by Red Bull Energy Drink, cranberry juice, apple cider, and ginger beer. Stir together ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add some (but not all) sliced lemons and cranberries.</li>
                <li>In each serving glass, place some ice, a few cranberries, a slice of lemon, and the beverage.</li>
                <li>Serve with cinnamon sticks if desired (again, I desire them).</li>
            </ol>
