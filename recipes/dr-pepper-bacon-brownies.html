        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe was posted to <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255431/dr-pepper-bacon-brownies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allrecipes</a> by user Gavin Logan Suazo, and its two eponymous ingredients immediately caught my eye.</p>
            <p>He describes it as a crowd-pleaser, and if the crowd consists wholly of myself, I think there's no question whether it'll be pleased.  Though I've modified the recipe to use my favorite specific type of Dr. Pepper.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 (12 fl oz) can Dr. Pepper & Cream Soda Zero Sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup butter</li>

                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (Optional, but I love me some cinnamon, so I'll make sure to use it)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) bag milk chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Separate Ingredients for Frosting</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup butter</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350° F (175° C). Grease 12x18-inch pan with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Combine 1 cup Dr. Pepper & Cream Soda Zero Sugar and 1 cup butter in saucepan over medium-low heat.  Heat until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
                <li>Place bacon in large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 8 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, white sugar, ¼ cup cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt together in large bowl.</li>
                <li>Whisk buttermilk, vanilla extract, and baking soda together in small bowl.  Pour flour mixture and mix until batter is blended.  Add butter mixture, ⅓ of the bacon, and chocolate chips, then mix thoroughly.  Spread in prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from sides of pan, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine 6 tablespoons Dr. Pepper & Cream Soda Zero Sugar, ½ cup butter, and 3 tablespoons cocoa powder in saucepan and bring to boil.  Remove from heat.  Add ½ of remaining bacon and confectioners' sugar and whisk until frosting is smooth.</li>
                <li>Spread frosting over brownies. Garnish with remaining bacon. Cool until frosting sets, about 20 minutes. Cut into squares.</li>
            </ol>
